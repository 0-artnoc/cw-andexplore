## About the Book

[*Exploring Android*](https://commonsware.com/AndExplore/)
is an integrated set of tutorials, guiding you step-by-step in building an 
Android application. 

The current source code for this book can be found in [this repository](https://gitlab.com/commonsguy/cw-andexplore). That GitLab repository has the code for the second-generation *Exploring Android*, demonstrating Kotlin and the Jetpack.

The repository that you are viewing is for the first-generation *Exploring Android*, demonstrating Java.

All of the source code in this archive is licensed under the
Apache 2.0 license except as noted.

Each directory in this repository reflects the "answers" to having completed
the tutorials to a certain point. So, for example, the `T14-RecyclerView/`
directory contains a copy of the app being built, after having completed the
14th tutorial ("Populating Our RecyclerView"). If you wish to import
the results of one of the tutorials into Android Studio, you want to import
the `ToDo/` directory inside of one of the top-level directories. In other
words, import `T14-RecyclerView/ToDo/`, not `T14-RecyclerView/`.

Remember,
**always check the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file before importing anything into Android Studio**,
as there is always the chance that somebody has published material linking you to a hacked Gradle installation.
